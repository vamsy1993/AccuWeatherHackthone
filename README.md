## Ask questions to your documents, locally!
In order to ask a question, run a command like:

python main.py
And wait for the script to require your input.

> Enter a city name (or 'exit' to quit):
Hit enter. You'll need to wait 2-5 seconds; you can then ask another city without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again.

Type exit to finish the script
